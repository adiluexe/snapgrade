Product Requirements Document: Web-Based Bubble Sheet Grader

1. Introduction
   This document outlines the core requirements and features for a web-based application designed to streamline the process of grading bubble sheet tests for educators. Inspired by tools like ZipGrade, this application aims to provide teachers with an efficient, accurate, and analytical grading solution accessible directly through a web browser.  
   Product Name Suggestion: SnapGrade
2. Problem Statement
   Traditional manual grading of multiple-choice bubble sheets is time-consuming, prone to human error, and lacks immediate analytical insights into student performance or common misconceptions. Existing desktop or mobile-only solutions may not offer the flexibility and accessibility of a web-based platform.
3. Solution Overview
   The Web-Based Bubble Sheet Grader will allow teachers to:
   ⦁ Define and upload answer keys for their tests.
   ⦁ Scan or upload images of completed student bubble sheets via a webcam or file upload.
   ⦁ Automatically grade the sheets using computer vision technology.
   ⦁ View individual student scores and comprehensive class-level analytics.
   ⦁ Export grading data for further analysis or record-keeping.
4. Key Features (Minimum Viable Product - MVP)
   To enable a rapid prototype, the following features are prioritized:
   4.1. User Management
   ⦁ Teacher Accounts: Simple registration and login functionality (email/password or social login).
   ⦁ Dashboard: A personalized landing page showing recent tests and quick actions.
   4.2. Test & Template Management
   ⦁ Pre-defined Templates: Provide a few standard bubble sheet templates (e.g., 50 questions, 100 questions, A/B/C/D options) to simplify initial setup for teachers.
   ⦁ Answer Key Input: Teachers can manually enter the correct answers for each question for a given test.
   4.3. Student Management
   ⦁ Student Roster: Ability to add students (Name, ID). This can be a simple list.
   4.4. Scanning & Grading
   ⦁ Image Upload: Teachers can upload images (JPEG, PNG) of completed bubble sheets.
   ⦁ Webcam Integration: Direct scanning of bubble sheets using the device's webcam (real-time processing for a smoother experience).
   ⦁ Automated Bubble Detection & Grading:
   ⦁ The system will identify the answer bubbles on the scanned sheet.
   ⦁ It will compare the filled bubbles against the provided answer key.
   ⦁ Calculate the score for each student.
   ⦁ Error Handling (Basic): Flag sheets that cannot be processed (e.g., poor image quality, missing alignment marks).
   4.5. Results & Analytics
   ⦁ Individual Student Scores: Display each student's total score and percentage.
   ⦁ Class Summary:
   ⦁ Average class score.
   ⦁ Highest/Lowest scores.
   ⦁ Number of students who passed/failed (based on a configurable threshold).
   ⦁ Question Analysis: Identify the most frequently missed questions across the class.
   4.6. Data Export
   ⦁ Excel Export (.csv): Ability to export a summary of student scores and basic analytics into a CSV file, easily openable in Excel. This will include:
   ⦁ Student Name
   ⦁ Student ID
   ⦁ Test Score (Raw)
   ⦁ Test Score (Percentage)
   ⦁ Correct Answers
   ⦁ Incorrect Answers
   ⦁ Unanswered Questions
5. AI/ML Guidelines & Considerations
   The core of this application relies heavily on computer vision, a subfield of AI.
   ⦁ Core AI/ML Component: Image Processing for Bubble Detection
   ⦁ Technique: Utilize image processing libraries (e.g., OpenCV) to:
   ⦁ Image Pre-processing: Grayscale conversion, noise reduction, thresholding to enhance bubble visibility.
   ⦁ Perspective Correction: Correct for skewed images taken at an angle.
   ⦁ Alignment Mark Detection: Identify fiducial markers on the sheet to align the template with the scanned image.
   ⦁ Contour Detection/Shape Recognition: Identify circular or oval shapes corresponding to bubbles.
   ⦁ Fill Detection: Determine if a bubble is filled based on pixel intensity within its region.
   ⦁ MVP Implementation: Focus on robust detection for clear, well-lit scans.
   ⦁ Future AI/ML Enhancements (Beyond MVP):
   ⦁ Handwriting Recognition (OCR): Automatically read student names or IDs from the sheet to link to the roster. This is significantly more complex.
   ⦁ Adaptive Learning Recommendations: Based on common mistakes, suggest learning resources or topics for students to review.
   ⦁ Automated Template Generation: Allow teachers to upload any PDF/image of a bubble sheet and have the system automatically identify question areas and bubbles.
   ⦁ Anomaly Detection: Identify unusual patterns in grading (e.g., suspicious answer patterns).
6. High-Level User Flow
7. Teacher Registration/Login: Teacher creates an account or logs in.
8. Create New Test: Teacher names the test and selects a pre-defined bubble sheet template.
9. Enter Answer Key: Teacher inputs the correct answers for the test.
10. Scan/Upload Sheets: Teacher uses the webcam to scan student sheets one by one, or uploads images from their device.
11. Review & Confirm: The system displays a quick preview of the graded sheet (e.g., correct/incorrect marks). Teacher confirms or manually corrects if needed.
12. View Results: Teacher navigates to the test results page to see class summary and individual scores.
13. Export Data: Teacher clicks a button to download the results as a CSV file.

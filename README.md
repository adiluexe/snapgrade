> 🚧 **This is a work-in-progress project for practicing Next.js, React, and TypeScript development.** The AI functionality is not yet implemented, but you can explore the demo flow to see how the finished app will work.

## 📋 Project Status

**Current State**: Frontend prototype with demo functionality  
**Purpose**: Learning and practicing modern web development  
**Next Phase**: Implementing actual AI/computer vision technology

### What's Working Now:

- ✅ Complete UI/UX design and animations
- ✅ Demo flow showing how the app will work
- ✅ Responsive design and PWA features
- ✅ Authentication system setup
- ✅ Dashboard and analytics mockups

### What's Coming Later:

- 🔄 Actual AI-powered bubble sheet recognition
- � Real camera integration for scanning
- 🔄 Computer vision processing
- 🔄 Database integration for real data
- 🔄 Production-ready deployment

## 🎯 Try the Demo

Experience the app concept and explore the user flow:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Modern web browser

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/adiluexe/snapgrade.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd snapgrade

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to explore the demo.

### Demo Features

- **Landing Page** - Complete marketing site with animations
- **Authentication Flow** - Sign up/sign in pages (demo only)
- **Dashboard** - Mockup of the main application interface
